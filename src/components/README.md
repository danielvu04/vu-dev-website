# Components

This folder contains reusable React components that make up the user interface of the application. Each component focuses on a specific part of the UI.

## Included Components
- **Navbar.js**: Handles the navigation bar for the website.
- **Hero.js**: Displays the hero section, which includes an introductory message and call-to-action buttons.
- **Footer.js**: Contains the footer section with links and copyright information.
- **FeaturedProjects.js**: Showcases featured projects in a card-style layout.

## Best Practices
- Keep each component focused on a single responsibility.
- Use prop validation to ensure proper data handling in components.
- If a component has specific styles, consider adding a corresponding CSS or module file in this folder.
