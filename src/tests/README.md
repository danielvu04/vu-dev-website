# Tests

This folder contains test files for the application. Tests help ensure the application works as expected and prevent bugs when making changes.

## Files
- **App.test.js**: Unit tests for the `App.js` component.
- **setupTests.js**: Configuration file for setting up the testing environment (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).

## Best Practices
- Write tests for each component to verify rendering, functionality, and edge cases.
- Use the React Testing Library for testing React components.
- Run tests frequently using `npm test` to catch issues early.
