# Styles

This folder contains global and component-specific CSS files to style the application.

## Files
- **App.css**: General styles for the application.
- **index.css**: Global styles, including font settings, default margins, and other foundational styles.

## Best Practices
- Follow consistent naming conventions for CSS classes.
- Avoid inline styles whenever possible; prefer external styles for maintainability.
- Use utility classes (e.g., from Tailwind CSS) where applicable.
